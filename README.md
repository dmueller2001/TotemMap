WordPress Leaflet.js plugin for DiscoverTotems Site

This plug-in consists of four files that when properly zipped up can be uploaded via the WordPress Dashboard easily. 

First, download all 4 files into a directory called 'totem-map'

Create a sub-directory called "_inc" and place the following three .js files in it:
    mapmaker.js
    singlemapmaker.js
    leaflet-providers.js
zip up the directory into a .zip extension file
Upload it via the Dashboard>Plugins>Install New>Upload

Then insall the "Appliance" theme via the Dashboard>Appearance>Search on "Appliance"

This plug-in works with the "Appliance" WordPress Theme by Emily Conway (http://www.applymedia.co.uk/appliance/). It is a baseline theme to you get started. Appliance is a clean and minimalist theme that is ideal for blogs / magazines / portfolios. It's spacious, minimalist, clean, light and very fast to load. 

We use the WordPress iPhone and Android applications to do data collections and posting directly to the site.
