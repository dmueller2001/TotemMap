WordPress Leaflet.js plugin for DiscoverTotems Site

This plug-in consists of four files that when properly zipped up can be uploaded via the WordPress Dashboard easily. 

First, download all 4 files into a directory called 'totem-map'

Create a sub-directory called "_inc" and place the following three .js files in it:
    mapmaker.js
    singlemapmaker.js
    leaflet-providers.js
Zip up the directory into a .zip extension file
Upload it via the Dashboard>Plugins>Install New>Upload User Interface in WordPress

We recommend using the Appliance WordPress Theme as a baseline to get started with and using the WordPress iPhone and Android applications to do data collections.
